In Lucy's Bubblery you will take the role of little Lucy's helper.
She wants to clean her plushies using bubbles!
But there is a problem, each plushie has its own preference, and there are a lot of plushies.

You will notice plushies arriving at your counter, having their own unique orders.
Your job is to mix the ingredients to match the order and deliver the bubble in a timely manner.
The game gets progressively harder as time goes on.
If you take too long, a plushie may leave, losing you a customer.
When 3 customers are lost, the game is over.
To win the game you must clean the plushies for 3 minutes.
Are you up for the bubbly challenge?
